Reionization is thought to have occurred in the redshift range of 6<z<9, which is now being probed by both deep galaxy surveys and CMB observations. In Sun & Furlanetto (2016), we developed a model for the star formation efficiency (SFE) of dark matter halos at z > 6 using the halo abundance matching over technique and assuming smooth, continuous gas accretion. We find that the SFE peaks at about a few tens percent at halo masses $$10^{10}\,M_\odot$$, in qualitative agreement with its behavior at lower redshifts.

In Mirocha et al. (2017), We build a new model for the global 21-cm signal that is calibrated to measurements of the high-z galaxy luminosity function (LF) and further tuned to match the observed Thomson scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background.
