LIMFAST is a semi-numerical tool currently under development for simulating multiple LIM signals simultaneously and self-consistently. It stems from the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/411/2/955/1273635">21cmFAST</a> code, and includes significantly updated sub-grid models for the source populations. In particular, We couple a simple yet physically-motivated prescription for the star formation and chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies to models of emission lines based on simulations of photoionization and radiative transfer. LIMFAST is a convenient and versatile tool that allows one to explore a wide range of applications of multi-tracer intensity mapping to the investigation of the epoch of reionization and cosmic dawn. Watch out for a forthcoming series of LIMFAST papers if you're interested!
