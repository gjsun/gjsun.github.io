Hello! I'm a CIERA Postdoctoral Fellow based at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Lying at the interface of theory and observations, my research spans a range of topics related to cosmological galaxy formation in the high-redshift universe. I use high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations, semi-numerical models, as well as analytic theories to investigate the physics behind the formation of the first galaxies and its large-scale effects. 

Prior to my current position, I obtained my PhD degree from Caltech in 2022 and bachelor degree from UCLA in 2015 (yes you can call me a veteran Angeleno). I was born and grew up in Beijing before moving to the US for college.
